# Verify Authority Page

Make a best effort to confirm the website for each business record is the best, official "authority page".

The "authority page" is the official website for the business.

If you wanted a friend to meet you at the business location described below, would you feel confident emailing your friend the linked website as their only source of finding you?

To confirm the authority page it may be necessary to visit linked pages such as "Contact Us", "About Us", etc., to verify that the contact details at least loosely match our original business record.

Be aware of chains and umbrella companies! If the website is the homepage for an organization that has multiple locations, then the website is probably not the authority page.
The only way the website would be the authority page in this case is if the business record appears to be the home office of the organizaiton as shown on the website.

If the business record's website does not appear to be the best authority page (or there's no website value at all), a best effort should be made to find the best authority page and correct the record's website to be the URL for that page.


# Verify Attributes via Authority Page

For each of the following attributes in the busines record, verify the value against the record's authority page.

* name
* address
* locality
* region
* postcode
* tel

If the value on the authority page is different, correct the business record value.


# Phone Verify

This step is for business records for which a correct authority page could not be identified, and we have a telephone value.

Call each such business and verify their business details.

For each record, we would like to make a reasonable attempt to reach a representative of the business and verify each business attribute.

* name
* address
* locality
* region
* postcode
* tel

When a representative is reached, first verify it's the correct business.

 each business attribute should be verified and corrected if necessary. For each attribute we'd like to know whether it was:
* already correct
* blank, now filled with correct value
* incorrect, now corrected
* not verified (due to represetnative not knowing, or not answering for some other reason)

If you reach an automated message on the first attempt, please try at least one more time, preferably at a different time of day (but during normal business hours for the time zone of the business).

If the person asks you questions about who you are, why you're calling, and what you're doing with the data, you can say:
"I'm helping Factual verify they have the correct data for this business. This data will be used to correct Factual's database of businesses."
If they want to know who Factual is, you can tell them that Factual helps people find relevant businesses for mobile and web users searching for particular businesses.
If the person wants to keep asking more questions, or if they seem annoyed at any time, you are free to politely excuse yourself and mark the record as "Unwilling".

Each record run through Phone Verify should be marked with one of these summary outcomes:
* Verified (a business representative was reached, and at least one attribute of the business was verified)
* Voicemail (every attempt resulted in an automated voicemail message)
* Unwilling (a person was reached, but they were not cooperative)
* Disconnected (telephone is not in service)
* Wrong Number (telephone number is not for this business)
* Other (please describe in notes)
